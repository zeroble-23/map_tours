# About the App

- 'My Trips' allows the user to navigate through several cities around the world.
- Clicking on the arrows or on the locations from the dropdown menu will zoom-in to the location. 
- Along with each location a popup will show with the trip's date and a picture of the location. 
- The navigator goes through the locations in date order (oldest to newest).
- Location data is stored in the locations.json file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
